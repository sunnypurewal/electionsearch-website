        <h2>A new search engine</h2> that helps us find news articles about the 2019 Canadian Election.
        It is an open-source project and the code is available on <a href="https://github.com/sunnypurewal" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

        <h2>Why not just use Google?</h2> Google, Facebook, and Twitter all make a huge portion of their revenue through
        selling ads. When we search for election news, we want to see relevant articles from reputable sources and that's it.
        The ads we see are not only distractions, but are sometimes paid for by illegitimate foreign entities.
